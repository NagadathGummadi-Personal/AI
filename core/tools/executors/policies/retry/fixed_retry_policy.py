class FixedRetryPolicy(IRetryPolicy):

    Fixed delay retry policy.
    
    Retries with a fixed delay between attempts. Simple and predictable.
    
    Features:
        - Configurable number of attempts
        - Fixed delay between retries
        - Configurable retryable exceptions
        - Optional jitter to avoid thundering herd
    
    Usage:
        policy = FixedRetryPolicy(
            max_attempts=3,
            delay_seconds=2.0,
            jitter=0.5  # ±0.5 seconds random jitter
        )
        
        spec.retry_policy = policy
    
    Example:
        # Attempt 1: Execute immediately
        # Fails
        # Wait 2 seconds
        # Attempt 2: Execute
        # Fails
        # Wait 2 seconds
        # Attempt 3: Execute
        # If fails, raise exception
